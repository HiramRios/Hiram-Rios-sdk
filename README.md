# Hiram-Rios-sdk

The purpose of this assignment is to create a sdk for the https://the-one-api.dev/documentation The one api.

The sdk will allow developer and users to easily access the api's data and filter through the infomation without the use of having to set up multiple scripts to access the api itself 

The sdk will have a set of commands that will allow the user to call them to access specific information 

The following image shows a sample of how use the api call functions and a desciption how to use the api and what each api call does. Furthemore the python page shows how to import the functions.py to have access to the calls:

Steps to download the sdk: 
pip install Hiram-sdk-lotr==0.0.1

Steps through the repository:

you can then run the commands through main.py on a ide or through terminal to call functions 

on terminal:

cd to directory 

type command "pip install requests"

type command "python3" to enter the python mode to call commands

type command "from Hiram_sdk_the_one.functions import * " to acess the fucntions

type any command function like "print(get_book())"
